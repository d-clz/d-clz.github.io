`logiops` is an unofficial driver for Logitech mice and keyboard
*(Currently compatible only with HID++ >2.0 devices.)*  

In this article, we will try to customize Logitech MX Anywhere 3 Wireless Mouse buttons using [logiops](https://github.com/PixlOne/logiops), as a replace solution for [Logitech Options](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/options) which support Windows & Mac only.

## Install `logiops` from AUR
### 1. Dependencies:
- This project requires C++14 complier, `cmake`, `libevdev`, `libudev` and `libconfig`.
- Install dependencies:
```
    yay -S cmake libevdev libconfig pkgconf
```
- Simply install `logiops` with Arch User Repository:
```
    yay -S logiops-git
```
### 2. Start using `logiops`
- Start logiops daemon with `systemd`:
```
    sudo systemctl start logid
```
- Set daemon to start at boot:
```
    sudo systemctl enable logid
```

## Custom keys binding
### 1. Useful commands:
- Listing for connected device:
```
    sudo logid -v
```
- Debug config file (Highly recommend using when config file changed, by default is `/etc/logid.cfg`)
```
    sudo logid -v -c /etc/logid.cfg
```
### 2. Remappable Keys & Features

MX Anywhere 3 Button's CID table:
| Buttons           | CID  |

|Magspeed Wheel     | 0x52 |
|Mode Shift Button  | 0xc4 |
|Back (thumb button)| 0x53 |
|Forward (thumb btn)| 0x56 |
All these 4 keys are gestures supported, we're going to customize them.  
Other 3 buttons are Mouse click buttons (`0x50` and `0x51`) and Devices Swicht Button (`0xd7`), just leave them alone for not getting fucked.
