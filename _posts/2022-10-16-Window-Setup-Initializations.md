Seting up a new working environment for Windows.
Since my company assign me a window11 workstation in my onboarding day, I realize that I need to have to workaround with Windows an PowerShell. Hope there's something you guys can use ðŸ˜ƒ.

## Terminal
### 1. PowerShell 7
Windows came with PowerShell 5.1 by default.
If you're willing to try, here's the [tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.2).
### 2. Windows Terminal

## PowerShell
### 1. Chocolately
- First, we need some package manager (or actually a *window-cli-installer*, as we called it ðŸ˜…), [chocolately](https://chocolatey.org/install) work for me. You can consider [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) or [Winget]() instead.
- To install **Chocolately**, make sure you have an administrative shell (right-click powershel and 'Run as Administrator') and paste this:
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```
- After that, you may need to restart your computer, then you can use `choco install` to install your needs.

### 2. Shell promt with oh-my-posh
After a while, I found [oh-my-posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/) ðŸ˜•. Yep, that's it.
Similar to what I normally use for Zsh in Linux, and also has the built-in [spaceship-promt](https://spaceship-prompt.sh/)
- Install/Update oh-my-posh:
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; Invoke-Expression ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://ohmyposh.dev/install.ps1'))
```
- Fonts: 
	- Arcording to the [docs](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/fonts), we need to install [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) for the promt working properly.
	- You can find fonts that recommend in the [docs](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/fonts) and install whatever you want.
- Edit `$PROFILE` (similar to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` in Linux):
```
notepad $PROFILE
```
> **âš  Create new Profile if doesn't exist:**
> ```Powershell
> New-Item -Path $PROFILE -Type File -Force
> ```
- Add this line to your `$PROFILE`
```
oh-my-posh init pwsh --config "$env:POSH_THEMES_PATH/${YOUR_THEME}.omp.json" | Invoke-Expression
```
You can choose whatever you want in the built-in [theme list](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/themes) and replace the `${YOUR_THEME}` with it.

### 3. Shell auto-completions & auto-suggestions
Do you get tired of typing CTRL+R to look up commands in the history? Similar to `zsh-autosuggestions`, simply add the following to your profile:
```
# up&down arrow for history search 
Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler -Key UpArrow -Function HistorySearchBackward 
Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler -Key DownArrow -Function HistorySearchForward
```
Add one more if youâ€™d like to view all autocomplete options after pressing TAB:
```
# menu complete using TAB instead of CTRL+SPACE
Set-PSReadlineKeyHandler -Chord Tab -Function MenuComplete
```

### 4. MagicTooltips
This gif explain everything ðŸ˜†.

            Template = "\ufd03 {value}"
        }
        Kubernetes = @{
            Commands = "k,kubectl,helm,kubens,kubectx,oc,istioctl,kogito,k9s,helmfile"
            FgColor = "#3970e4"
            Template = "\ufd31 {value}"
        }
        Aws = @{
            Commands = "aws,awless,terraform,pulumi,terragrunt"
            FgColor = "#EC7211"
            BgColor = ""
            Template = "\uf270 {value}"
        }
    }
}
Import-Module MagicTooltips
```

## Neovim
For me, who start with the Linux Vim since the first day, Window Notepad or even Notepad++ such a pain for typing ðŸ˜….
- First install Neovim with chocolately:
```
choco install neovim
```
- Install [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):
```
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim |`
    ni "$(@($env:XDG_DATA_HOME, $env:LOCALAPPDATA)[$null -eq $env:XDG_DATA_HOME])/nvim-data/site/autoload/plug.vim" -Force
```
- Configuring Neovim & vim-plug:
By default for window, nvim's stdpath at `C:\Users\$USERNAME\AppData\Local\nvim`. You can open a new nvim and type `:h init.vim` to check it out.

- Create whatever you want for the vim-plug configurations inside `init.vim`. For references, checkout my default configurations at [github](https://github.com/d-clz/nvim.git).
- Start nvim and run `:PlugInstall`, nvim is now ready to use ðŸ‘Œ.
